# Exploratory-Data-Analysis with Seaborn

### Exploratory Data Analysis : 
In simple words, it is about exploring the data. Knowing the characteristics of the data and to find if they will fit in the future modelling.
Basically, summarising their characteristics with visual methods.

In this project, *Breast Cancer Wisconsin data* is used, it contains characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

### **Knowing the Subject:**
- Breast cancer occur in women and rarely in men. About 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime.
- This data is particularly mined from the regions of Wisconsin, US. (refer to kaggle datasets to download)
- There are two types of tumor namely *Malign* and *Benign*.
  * Malign is the tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. (critical)
  * Beign is the tumor that **does not** invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body.
  
### Concepts Used:
- Plots:
  * Violinplot
  * Boxplot
  * Swarmplot
  * Heatmap
- Dimensionality reduction


### Conclusion:
The dataset had noise which was apparent through the visual plots. By using the dimensionality reduction, we remove the variables which are highly correlated. Now the dataset can be carried on for the classification.
